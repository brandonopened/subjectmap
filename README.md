# SubjectMap
Converts an LTI Resource Search subject taxonomy to CASE expressed taxonomy.  This is a multistage process of converting the LTI Resource Search expressed taxonomy as CASE to be handled in OpenSALT.  Then other code will handle two taxonomies available in OpenSALT and suggest possible associations.

## LTISearchSubjectsToCASE.GO

Converts a list of subjects that is an LTI Resource Search payload into a CASE expressed taxonomy to be loaded into OpenSALT
